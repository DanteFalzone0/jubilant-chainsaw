Several months ago I bought a book about C++ which was
published in 2005. I tried to use this book to teach myself
C++. In retrospect, it turns out that the C++ I was writing
was very, very bad, because I had big gaps in my knowledge
of C. What I was writing was essentially C with classes and
iostreams, and I wrote no makefiles, wrote all my
implementations in the headers instead of just writing
declarations in them, and didn't use the modern C++ features
that should be the real reason to write something in C++
instead of C.

My goal with this repository is to start fresh, and try to
teach myself how to write modern C++, the Right Way.
